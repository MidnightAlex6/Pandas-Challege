In this assignment, I created and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

#Backgroud

I am anew Chief Data Scientist for a city's school district. I'm helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

My first first task, I have been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, I created a report that includes the following data. My report also includes a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

#District Summary

I Performed the necessary calculations and then created a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.
This included:

•	Total number of unique schools

•	Total students

•	Total budget

•	Average math score

•	Average reading score

•	% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

•	% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

•	% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

#School Summary

I Performed the necessary calculations and then created a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.

This includes the following:

Include the following:

•	School name

•	School type

•	Total students

•	Total school budget

•	Per student budget

•	Average math score

•	Average reading score

•	% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

•	% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

•	% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
